## Stock Trading Strategy Development

This project aims to build a model to predict stock movements and optimize portfolio performance using historical stock data. The initial phase involves data preparation, including:

- Installing required dependencies.
- Downloading historical stock data from Yahoo Finance for selected stocks.
- Normalizing data for consistency.
- Splitting data into training and testing sets.

By completing this stage, youâ€™ll have a clean, structured dataset ready for model training.

### Objectives

To complete the data preparation stage:

- Install required packages: `wrds`, `swig`, `FinRL`, `torch_geometric`, `optuna`, `streamlit`, and `quantstats`.
- Download stock data for selected stocks from Yahoo Finance.
- Normalize data using scaling techniques.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
