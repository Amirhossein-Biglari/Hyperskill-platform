# Decision Tree Implementation

## Description

This project focuses on implementing a decision tree algorithm from scratch using Python, NumPy, and Pandas. Decision trees are widely used in machine learning for their ease of interpretation and similarity to human decision-making processes.

### Objectives

- Understand the decision tree algorithm.
- Implement a decision tree for classification.
- Process both categorical and numerical features.
- Apply the decision tree to a real dataset.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Project Overview

1. **Algorithm Exploration**: Delve into the mechanics of the decision tree algorithm.
2. **Implementation**: Write the decision tree from scratch.
3. **Feature Processing**: Handle categorical and numerical data.
4. **Application**: Test the decision tree on a real-world dataset.
