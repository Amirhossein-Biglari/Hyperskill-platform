# Random Forest from Scratch

## Project Overview
This project aims to consolidate your knowledge of the Random forest algorithm by implementing it from scratch using numpy. You will compare the performance of your implementation against a standalone decision tree and examine the effects of increasing the number of trees on overfitting.

## About
In this project, we will dive into implementing one of the most popular yet straightforward ensemble algorithms â€” Random Forest. We will build the entire algorithm from scratch using numpy and test it on the Titanic dataset from sklearn.
