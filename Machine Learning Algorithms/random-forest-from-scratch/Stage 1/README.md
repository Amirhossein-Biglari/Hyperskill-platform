## Stage 1: Simple Standalone Decision Tree

### Description
The first stage involves testing the effectiveness of a simple standalone decision tree. This serves as a baseline for comparison with more complex models in later stages. The focus is on measuring the model's accuracy.

### Objectives
1. Use the `DecisionTreeClassifier` from sklearn to create a decision tree.
2. Fit the model to the training dataset.
3. Make predictions on the test dataset.
4. Calculate and print the accuracy of the predictions, rounded to three decimal places, using sklearn's `accuracy_score` function.
