# Beep Boop, Is This Even Working?

## Description
Once you assemble the class, you can compare the model against the standalone Decision Tree from Stage 1. To do that, fit your `RandomForestClassifier` and make a prediction for all the objects in the training set. After that, print the resulting accuracy.

At this point, you can fiddle with the model parameters. Try changing the number of trees and/or other model parameters to see how accuracy varies. It is not required to complete the objective, but it would provide a more fulfilling experience.

## Objectives
1. Fit your `RandomForestClassifier` on the whole training set.
2. Predict labels for all the objects in the test set.
3. Calculate and print the resulting accuracy rounded to three digits after the dot (e.g., 3.141). 
   - Is the accuracy better or worse than the one in Stage 1?
