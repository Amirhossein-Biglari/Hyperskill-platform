# Basic Income Metrics for Accounting Companies

## Project Overview
This project involves an analysis of income data from two accounting companies, specifically from their recycling organization databases. The project aims to provide novice data analysts with the foundational skills necessary to understand and compute basic statistical metrics, facilitating insights into the distribution and characteristics of income generated by recycling pick-up points.

## Objectives
- **Comparison of Income Data:** Compare the income data between Company 1 and Company 2.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculate `mean`, `median`, `total range`, `interquartile range`, `standard deviation`, and `variance` of the `money_in` column for both companies using SQL functions.
- **Precision in Results:** Ensure all calculated means, standard deviations, and variances are rounded to two decimal places for clarity and precision.
