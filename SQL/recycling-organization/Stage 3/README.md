# Net Income Analysis by Pick-Up Point

## Project Description

In this third stage of our ongoing project, we turn our attention to a detailed examination of the net income generated by each pick-up point within the recycling organization's network. This stage involves calculating and comparing the income and expenses for each collection point serviced by two accounting firms, Company 1 and Company 2.

## Objectives

- **Calculate Total Income and Outcome:** Compute the total income and total outcome by summing up `money_in` and `money_out` respectively for each pick-up point from both Company 1 and Company 2.
- **Determine Net Income:** For each pick-up point, calculate the net income by subtracting total outcome from total income.
- **Data Integration:** Use JOINs to effectively combine data from multiple tables for comprehensive analysis.
- **Sorting Results:** Present the results ordered first by `company_name` in ascending order and then by `net_income` in descending order to highlight the most and least profitable points.
