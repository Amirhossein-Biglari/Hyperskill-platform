# Vector Database Basics with Qdrant - Stage 1

## Stage 1: Abstract Loading

### Goal
The goal of this stage is to set up a Qdrant database and load scientific paper metadata from an arXiv dataset. This lays the foundation for building a vector search engine that can retrieve relevant papers based on a natural language query.

### Key Objectives
- **Understanding Qdrant and Vector Search**  
  Gain insights into how vector databases work and their role in information retrieval.

- **Dataset Preparation**  
  Download and organize the arXiv dataset, ensuring it contains relevant metadata and embeddings.

- **Setting Up Qdrant**  
  Deploy Qdrant locally using Docker and configure it to store and manage vector data.

- **Connecting to Qdrant**  
  Establish a connection with the Qdrant database and prepare it for data ingestion.

- **Data Ingestion and Processing**  
  Efficiently parse and load paper metadata into Qdrant while ensuring proper structuring and storage.

- **Verification and Testing**  
  Validate the loaded data using Qdrantâ€™s web interface and API, ensuring correct ingestion and accessibility.

### Lessons Learned
- Setting up and running a vector database.
- Understanding structured metadata and text embeddings.
- Handling large-scale data ingestion efficiently.
- Verifying and testing data storage in a vector search system.

This stage sets the groundwork for performing vector search operations in later stages.
